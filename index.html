        <p> I am a web development student and I am also taking Computing Fundamentals and learning Coral. I do work full time at Sherwin Williams but aside from school and work in my free time I love to spend time with my Golden Retriever and my fiancee. This class has been a little challenging for me but I am happy to be learning so much!</p>
